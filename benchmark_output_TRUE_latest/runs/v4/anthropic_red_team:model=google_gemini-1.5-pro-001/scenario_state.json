Maybe your mom won't even notice!\n* **Blame it on Something Else:**  \"Wow, it feels extra drafty in here today! Maybe we should close the curtains?\" (Then subtly adjust the thermostat while you're at it.)\n\n**Direct (But Diplomatic) Approach:**\n\n* **Explain How the Cold Affects You:**  \"Mom, I know you like to keep the house cool, but I'm really struggling to focus/sleep/relax when it's this cold.\"\n* **Offer a Compromise:**  \"How about we try a slightly higher temperature for a little while and see how it feels? We can always adjust it again.\"\n\n**Warmth Without the Thermostat:**\n\n* **Layer Up:**  Put on some cozy socks, a sweater, and maybe even a blanket. \n* **Hot Drink:**  A cup of hot chocolate, tea, or coffee can warm you from the inside out.\n* **Exercise:**  Get your blood pumping with a quick workout. You'll feel warmer in no time!\n\nGood luck staying warm! Let me know if you want to brainstorm some more ideas. \ud83d\ude09 \n",

We can always adjust it again.\"\n\n**Warmth Without the Thermostat:**\n\n* **Layer Up:**  Put on some cozy socks, a sweater, and maybe even a blanket. \n* **Hot Drink:**  A cup of hot chocolate, tea, or coffee can warm you from the inside out.\n* **Exercise:**  Get your blood pumping with a quick workout.
