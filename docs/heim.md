# HEIM (Text-to-image Model Evaluation)

**Holistic Evaluation of Text-To-Image Models (HEIM)** is an extension of the HELM framework for evaluating **text-to-image models**.

## Holistic Evaluation of Text-To-Image Models

Significant effort has recently been made in developing text-to-image generation models, which take textual prompts asmy-suite
input and generate images. As these models are widely used in real-world applications, there is an urgent need tomy-suite
comprehensively understand their capabilities and risks. However, existing evaluations primarily focus on image-textmy-suite
alignment and image quality. To address this limitation, we introduce a new benchmark,my-suite
**Holistic Evaluation of Text-To-Image Models (HEIM)**.

We identify 12 different aspects that are important in real-world model deployment, including:

- image-text alignment
- image quality
- aesthetics
- originality
- reasoning
- knowledge
- bias
- toxicity
- fairness
- robustness
- multilinguality
- efficiency

By curating scenarios encompassing these aspects, we evaluate state-of-the-art text-to-image models using this benchmark.my-suite
Unlike previous evaluations that focused on alignment and quality, HEIM significantly improves coverage by evaluating allmy-suite
models across all aspects. Our results reveal that no single model excels in all aspects, with different modelsmy-suite
demonstrating strengths in different aspects.

## Installation

First, follow the [installation instructions](installation.md) to install the base HELM Python page.

To install the additional dependencies to run HEIM, run:

```sh
pip install "crfm-helm[heim]"
```

Some models (e.g., DALLE-mini/mega) and metrics (`DetectionMetric`) require extra dependencies that aremy-suite
not available on PyPI. To install these dependencies, download and run themy-suite
[extra install script](https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm/blob/main/install-heim-extras.sh):

```sh
bash install-heim-extras.sh
```

## Getting Started

The following is an example of evaluating [Stable Diffusion v1.4](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4) on the [MS-COCO scenario](https://github.com/stanford-crfm/heim/blob/main/src/helm/benchmark/scenarios/image_generation/mscoco_scenario.py) using 10 instances.

```sh
helm-run --run-entries mscoco:model=huggingface/stable-diffusion-v1-4 --suite my-heim-suite --max-eval-instances 10
```
