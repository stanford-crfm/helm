            We introduce {benchmarkName}, an extensible evaluation framework for
            assessing LLM performance for medical tasks. Building on the HELM
            framework, {benchmarkName} comprises a structured taxonomy with 5
            categories, 22 subcategories, and 121 distinct clinical tasks as
            well as 35 distinct benchmarks (14 private, 7 gated-access, and 14
            public). The benchmarks represent a spectrum of healthcare
            scenarios, from diagnostic decision-making to patient communication,
            providing a more nuanced and medically relevant assessment of AI
            capabilities in healthcare settings.

            {benchmarkName} establishes a foundation for testing and evaluation
            of the real-world applicability of language models in healthcare. It
            is made possible by a unique collaboration between the Center for
            Research on Foundation Models, Technology and Digital Solutions at
            Stanford Healthcare, and Microsoft Healthcare and Life Sciences in
            partnership with faculty in the Departments of Medicine, Computer
            Science, Anesthesiology, Dermatology, Pediatrics and Biomedical Data
            Science as well as trainees from the MCiM program at the Clinical
            Excellence Research Center. The effort is coordinated by the Center
            for Biomedical Informatics Research.
