            Research on Foundation Models, Technology and Digital Solutions at
            Stanford Healthcare, and Microsoft Healthcare and Life Sciences in
            partnership with faculty in the Departments of Medicine, Computer

            Science as well as trainees from the MCiM program at the Clinical
            Excellence Research Center. The effort is coordinated by the Center
            for Biomedical Informatics Research.
