            Language models demonstrate powerful capabilities and pose
            significant risks. Given their widespread deployment, standardized
            public benchmarking of such models is vital. While language models
            are routinely evaluated on standard capability benchmarks,
            comparable standardization for benchmarking safety risks lags
            behind. To address this gap, we introduce HELM-Safety as a
            collection of 5 safety benchmarks that span 6 risk categories (e.g.
            violence, fraud, discrimination, sexual, harassment, deception). We
            present evaluation results for recent leading open weights and
            closed models.
