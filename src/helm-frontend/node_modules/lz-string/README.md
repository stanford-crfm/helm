lz-string
=========
LZ-based compression algorithm for JavaScript

## Warning (migrating from version 1.3.4 - nov 2014)
Files have changed locations and name since a recent release. The new release file is in `libs/lz-string.min.js` (or in `libs/lz-string.js` if you don't care for the minified version)

Sorry about the mess in other repos. This will not happen again.

## Note on server side

If you are using one of the ports of lz-string to decode on the server what was encoded in the browser, you might want to use version 1.3.7 as the version 1.3.8 introduced a slight change in the encoding. While the JS versions are completely cross-compatible, the PHP, Go, ... versions might not be as forgiving.

## Install via [npm](https://npmjs.org/)

```shell
$ npm install -g lz-string
$ lz-string input.js > output.txt
```
