> Piscina: A fast, efficient Node.js Worker Thread Pool implementation

Tinypool is a fork of piscina. What we try to achieve in this library, is to eliminate some dependencies and features that our target users don't need (currently, our main user will be Vitest). Tinypool's install size (38KB) can then be smaller than Piscina's install size (6MB). If you need features like [utilization](https://github.com/piscinajs/piscina#property-utilization-readonly) or [NAPI](https://github.com/piscinajs/piscina#thread-priority-on-linux-systems), [Piscina](https://github.com/piscinajs/piscina) is a better choice for you. We think that Piscina is an amazing library, and we may try to upstream some of the dependencies optimization in this fork.

- ‚úÖ Smaller install size, 38KB
- ‚úÖ Minimal
- ‚úÖ No dependencies
- ‚úÖ Physical cores instead of Logical cores with [physical-cpu-count](https://www.npmjs.com/package/physical-cpu-count)
- ‚ùå No utilization
- ‚ùå No NAPI

- Written in TypeScript, and ESM support only. For Node.js 14.x and higher.
