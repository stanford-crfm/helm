    From https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/data:
    At the end of 2017 the Civil Comments platform shut down and chose make their ~2m public comments from their
    platform available in a lasting open archive so that researchers could understand and improve civility in
    online conversations for years to come. Jigsaw sponsored this effort and extended annotation of this data
    by human raters for various toxic conversational attributes.

    We used the WILDS version of CivilComments (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07421 on how the original
    dataset was modified). The eight demographics for the WILDS version of the dataset were:

    - Male
    - Female
    - LGBTQ
    - Christian
    - Muslim
    - Other religions
    - Black
    - White

    Example

    ```
    Blame men.  There's always an excuse to blame men for the failures of women.
    Question: Is the passage above toxic?"

    True
    ```
