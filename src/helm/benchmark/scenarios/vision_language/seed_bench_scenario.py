    SEED-Bench: Benchmarking Multimodal LLMs with Generative Comprehension

    Based on powerful Large Language Models (LLMs), recent generative Multimodal
    Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained prominence as a pivotal research area.
    In Seed-Bench, we address the evaluation of generative comprehension in MLLMs
    as a preliminary step towards a comprehensive assessment of generative models.
    SEED-Bench consists of 19K multiple choice questions with accurate human annotations
    (x 6 larger than existing benchmarks), which spans 12 evaluation dimensions
    including the comprehension of both the image and video modality. We select 9
    evaluation aspects that take image as the input. In the benchmark,
    Multiple-choice questions with groundtruth options derived from human
    annotation enables an objective and efficient assessment of model performance,
    eliminating the need for human or GPT intervention during evaluation. We employ
    the multiple-choice metric for evaluating the performance of models.
