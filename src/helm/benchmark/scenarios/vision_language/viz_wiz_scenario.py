    VizWiz is a real-world visual question answering dataset consisting of questions
    asked by people who are blind. It originates from a natural visual question answering
    setting where blind people each took an image and recorded a spoken question about it,
    together with 10 crowdsourced answers per visual question.

    Version as of January 1, 2020:

    - 20,523 training image/question pairs
    - 205,230 training answer/answer confidence pairs
    - 4,319 validation image/question pairs
    - 43,190 validation answer/answer confidence pairs

    where answer confidences are one of {"yes", "maybe", "no"}.

    Answers are publicly shared for the train and validation splits and hidden for the test split.
