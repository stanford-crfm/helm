    """
    This scenario evaluates language models' ability to generate appropriate counseling responses
    in mental health conversations. The dataset contains counseling dialogues covering
    various topics including workplace issues, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, relationship 
    problems, and more.

    Each dialogue consists of interactions between a counselor and a client, where the counselor
    demonstrates expert mental health counseling techniques. The dialogues were selected based on high
    quality scores from multiple evaluators.

    Example dialogue structure:
    ```
    counselor: Hi there, to start can you tell me your name and a little bit about what's been going on?
    client: I sleep too much... I'm 23, female and work as IT professional. I feel like I'm not fitting in...
    counselor: I can see you have been facing challenges with feeling like you don't fit in...
    ```

    The task is to generate the next counselor response given the conversation history. Models
    are evaluated on their ability to:
    1. Provide empathetic and supportive responses
    2. Follow proper mental health counseling protocols
    3. Generate contextually appropriate interventions

    The dataset includes:
    - 7 complete dialogues covering different mental health topics
    - Metadata about dialogue topic and type
    - Gold-standard counselor responses as references
    - Full conversation history for context

    Each instance includes:
    - input: Previous conversation turns formatted with speaker labels
    - reference: The actual counselor's response (gold standard)
    - metadata: Topic and type of mental health conversation
