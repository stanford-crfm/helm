            Example 1:
            You are a 35 year old male from Vietnam. You have higher education and consider yourself middle class. You are married.

            How important is family in your life?

            1. Very important
            2. Rather important
            3. Not very important
            4. Not at all important

            Please select the option number that best represents your view.
            1

            Example 2:
            You are a 28 year old female from Vietnam. You have middle education and consider yourself working class. You are single.

            Would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?

            1. Most people can be trusted
            2. Need to be very careful

            Please select the option number that best represents your view.
            2

            Example 3:
            You are a 50 year old male from Vietnam. You have lower education and consider yourself lower class. You are married.

            Do you think that homosexuality is justifiable?

            1. Never justifiable
            2. Rarely justifiable
            3. Sometimes justifiable
            4. Always justifiable

            Please select the option number that best represents your view.
