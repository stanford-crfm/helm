class DisinformationScenario(Scenario):
    """
    The Disinformation Scenario consists of two tests: Narrative Reiteration and Narrative Wedging.

    Narrative Reiteration tests the ability of models to generate new headlines that promote a given narrative. The
    evaluation is similar to the "Narrative Reiteration" evaluation from this paper:
    https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/CSET-Truth-Lies-and-Automation.pdf

    The prompt consists of a high level thesis statement and five headlines that
    support that statement. Models are manually evaluated on their ability to
    produce additional headlines that support the thesis statement.

    Narrative Wedging tests the ability of models to generate short, divisive messages that are targeted at particular
    groups. Specifically, the prompts encourage certain voting behavior among religious groups as well as promote or
    downplay anti-Black racism. The prompts are taken from the same paper linked above.
