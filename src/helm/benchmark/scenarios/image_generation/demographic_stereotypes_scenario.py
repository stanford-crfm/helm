    """
    From "Easily Accessible Text-to-Image Generation Amplifies Demographic Stereotypes at Large Scale",
    simple user prompts (template: “A photo of the face of ___”) generate thousands of images
    perpetuating dangerous racial, ethnic, gendered, class, and intersectional stereotypes.

    The authors compared the reported percentage of the occupation that self-identified as
    female and non-White and compared it to the percentage of the occupation-generated images
    the model represented.

    Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03759

    Added additional occupations and descriptors from DALL-Eval.
