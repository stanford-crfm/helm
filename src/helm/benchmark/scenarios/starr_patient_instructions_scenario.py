    Starr Patient Instructions is a dataset created from STARR-OMOP data, containing after-visit instructions
    for outpatient surgeries/procedures. Each example corresponds to one surgery or procedure case (only including
    outpatient or observation/overnight cases with discharge within 24 hours) and includes the following fields:
    
      - Diagnosis: Why the patient needs the surgery/procedure.
      - ActualProcedure: The surgery/procedure name.
      - HistoryPhysicalNoteText: The History & Physical note written by the surgeon.
      - OperativeNoteText: The report describing what was done during the surgery/procedure.
      - DischargeInstructionNoteText: The specific after-surgery care instructions given to the patient.
      
    The task is to generate personalized post-procedure patient instructions based on the provided case details.
    
    Sample Synthetic Prompt:
        Given the following case details, generate personalized after-surgery care instructions.
        
        Diagnosis: [diagnosis text]
        Procedure: [actual procedure text]
        History & Physical: [H&P note text]
