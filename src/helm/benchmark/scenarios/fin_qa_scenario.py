INSTRUCTIONS = """Presented with a financial report consisting of textual contents and a structured table, given a question, generate the reasoning program in the domain specific langauge (DSL) that will be executed to get the answer.

The DSL consists of mathematical operations and table operations as executable programs. The program consists of a sequence of operations. Each operation takes a list of arguments.

There are 6 mathematical operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide, greater, exp, and 4 table aggregation operations table-max, table-min, table-sum, table-average, that apply aggregation operations on table rows. The mathematical operations take arguments of either numbers from the given reports, or a numerical result from a previous step.

The table operations take arguments of table row names. We use the special token #n to denote the result from the nth step.

For example, in the example "divide(9413, 20.01), divide(8249, 9.48), subtract(#0, #1)", the program consists of 3 steps; The first and the second division steps take arguments from the table and the text, respectively, then the third step subtracts the results from the two previous steps.

Definitions of all operations:

[["Name", "Arguments", "Output", "Description"],
["add", "number1, number2", "number", "add two numbers: number1 + number2"],
["subtract", "number1, number2", "number", "subtract two numbers: number1 âˆ’ number2"],
["multiply", "number1, number2", "number", "multiply two numbers: number1 * number2"],
["divide", "number1, number2", "number", "multiply two numbers: number1 / number2"],
["exp", "number1, number2", "number", "exponential: number1 ^ number2"],
["greater", "number1, number2", "bool", "comparison: number1 > number2"],
["table-sum", "table header", "number", "the summation of one table row"],
["table-average", "table header", "number", "the average of one table row"],
["table-max", "table header", "number", "the maximum number of one table row"],
["table-min", "table header", "number", "the minimum number of one table row"]]

    FinQA is a question answering task over financial reports that requires robust numerical reasoning.

    FinQA: A Dataset of Numerical Reasoning over Financial Data
    Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00122
    Code: https://github.com/czyssrs/FinQA

    Presented with a financial report consisting of textual contents and a structured table, given a question,
    the task is togenerate the reasoning program in the domain specific langauge (DSL) that will be executed
    to get the answer.

    We add the sub-headers "Pre-table text", "Table", "Post-table text" to the input. Example:

    ```
    Pre-table text: printing papers net sales for 2006 decreased 3% ( 3 % ) from both 2005 and 2004 due principally...
    [more lines]
    Table: [["in millions", "2006", "2005", "2004"], ["sales", "$ 6930", "$ 7170", "$ 7135"], ["operating profit", "$ 677", "$ 473", "$ 508"]]
    Post-table text: u.s .
    uncoated papers net sales in 2006 were $ 3.5 billion , compared with $ 3.2 billion in 2005 and $ 3.3 billion in 2004 .
    [more lines]
    Question: brazilian paper sales represented what percentage of printing papers in 2005?
