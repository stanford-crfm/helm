    The LSAT dataset is from the paper:
    https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06598

    Original repository can be found at:
    https://github.com/zhongwanjun/AR-LSAT

    This is a multi-choice QA dataset containing question that test analytical reasoning,
    from the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). The questions explore cases of constraint
    satisfaction, where there is a set of elements that need to be assigned while complying
    with given conditions, for instance: making 1-1 assignments of talks to dates ("assignment"),
    grouping students to teams ("grouping") or ordering classes in a schedule ("ordering").

    We can either evaluate all questions together ("all") or a subset of the questions:

    - grouping: in_out_grouping, distribution_grouping
    - ordering: simple ordering, relative_ordering, complex ordering
    - assignment: determined assignment, undetermined assignment
    - miscellaneous

    We prompt models using the following format:

    Input

        Passage: <passage>
        Question: <question>
        A. ...
        B. ...
        C. ...

    Output (Target completion)

        B

    Using an example from the training dataset, we have:

    Input

        Passage: Of the eight students - George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert -
        in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days - Monday,
        Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day - one in the morning and one in
        the afternoon - according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can
        give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then
        on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
        Question: Which one of the following could be the schedule of the students' reports?
        A. Mon. morning: Helen; Mon. afternoon: Robert Tues. morning: Olivia; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed.
            morning: Lenore; Wed. afternoon: Kyle
        B. Mon. morning: Irving; Mon. afternoon: Olivia Tues. morning: Helen; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed.
            morning: Nina; Wed. afternoon: Lenore
        C. Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed.
            morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving
        D. Mon. morning: Nina; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: Robert; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed.
            morning: Olivia; Wed. afternoon: Lenore
        E. Mon. morning: Olivia; Mon. afternoon: Nina Tues. morning: Irving; Tues. afternoon: Helen Wed.
