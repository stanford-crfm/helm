        Document: {This case is about an apprenticeship test that had a disparate impact
                    on Black apprenticeship applicants. The Equal Employment Opportunity
                    Commission (EEOC) filed this lawsuit on December 27, 2004, in U.S.
                    District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Filing on behalf
                    of thirteen Black individuals and a class of similarly situated Black
                    apprenticeship test takers, the EEOC alleged that the individuals’
                    employer, the Ford Motor Company, as well as their union, the United
                    Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural implement workers of America
                    (the “UAW”), and the Ford-UAW Joint Apprenticeship Committee, violated
                    Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and Michigan state
                    anti-discrimination law. The EEOC sought injunctive relief and damages
                    for the Black apprenticeship applicants. The individuals also brought a
                    separate class action against Ford and the UAW, and the cases were
                    consolidated. In June 2005, both cases were resolved via a class
                    settlement agreement. Ford agreed to pay $8.55 million and to implement
                    a new selection process for its apprenticeship programs, and the court
                    ordered Ford to cover attorneys’ fees and expenses. This case is closed.}
        Summary: {2005 class action settlement resulted in Ford paying $8.55m to redesign
                    its selection process for apprenticeship programs to address the
                    previous process’s disparate impact on Black applicants.}
