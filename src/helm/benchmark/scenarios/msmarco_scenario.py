class MSMARCOScenario(Scenario):
    """Scenario implementing MS MARCO challenge tasks.

    I. Overview

        MS MARCO (Microsoft MAchine Reading COmprehension) is a collection of
        large search datasets, collected using BING search questions, first
        released in (Bajaj et. al., 2016) and expanded ever since. The official
        MS MARCO website details all the available datasets and the proposed
        tasks: https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/.

    II. Task

        In this scenario, we are focusing on information retrieval tasks from
        the MS MARCO benchmark. We frame the information retrieval task as a
        binary classification problem, similar to
        (Nogueira and Jiang et. al., 2020). Specifically, given a context and a
        question, the model's job is to predict whether the context includes an
        answer to the question by producing either a correct answer or a wrong
        answer. The specific tokens used for the correct and wrong answers are
        specified in the adapter specification. Shared below is an example of
        how we would construct a prompt for a question, using 4 in-context
        training instances, where the correct and wrong output tokens are
        respectively specified as `Yes` and `No` in the adapter specification.
        Note that the last instance in the example, which is the instance we
        are evaluating, doesn't have an answer - since we want our model to
        answer the question.

            Passage: Its 25 drops per ml, you guys are all wrong. If it is water, the standard was changed 15 - 20 years ago to make 20 drops = 1mL. The viscosity of most things is temperature dependent, so this would be at room temperature. Hope this helps.
            Query: how many eye drops per ml
            Does the passage answer the query?
            Answer: Yes

            Passage: RE: How many eyedrops are there in a 10 ml bottle of Cosopt? My Kaiser pharmacy insists that 2 bottles should last me 100 days but I run out way before that time when I am using 4 drops per day.In the past other pharmacies have given me 3 10-ml bottles for 100 days.E: How many eyedrops are there in a 10 ml bottle of Cosopt? My Kaiser pharmacy insists that 2 bottles should last me 100 days but I run out way before that time when I am using 4 drops per day.
            Query: how many eye drops per ml
            Does the passage answer the query?
            Answer: No

            Passage: : You can transfer money to your checking account from other Wells Fargo. accounts through Wells Fargo Mobile Banking with the mobile app, online, at any. Wells Fargo ATM, or at a Wells Fargo branch. 1 Money in â€” deposits.
            Query: can you open a wells fargo account online
            Does the passage answer the query?
            Answer: No

            Passage: You can open a Wells Fargo banking account from your home or even online. It is really easy to do, provided you have all of the appropriate documentation. Wells Fargo has so many bank account options that you will be sure to find one that works for you. They offer free checking accounts with free online banking.
            Query: can you open a wells fargo account online
            Does the passage answer the query?
            Answer: Yes

            Passage: SIZE: There are few measurements available for this bear. Adult spectacled bears can weigh between 140 and 385 pounds (63-173 kg). However, the body length of adults is about 150 to 180 centimeters (60 to 72 inches) and males may be 30 to 40 percent larger than females.
            Query: how much does a spectacled bear weigh
            Does the passage answer the query?
            Answer:

        As a result of each request, the model would produce a token or a set
        of tokens. To determine the ranking of a list of contexts for a
        question, we create a separate request for each context, where we pair
        the question with the context and ask for model's answer.

        Then, in the corresponding metric for our scenario, the contexts are
        ranked using the answer token and its log probability. Specifically, the
        ordering looks like the list given below, from good contexts at the top
        to bad contexts at the bottom, where UNKNOWN_ANSWER would correspond
        to any token that is not one of correct or wrong answer tokens, using
        case insensitive match excluding whitespace.

            (1) CORRECT_ANSWER, highest log probability
                ...
                CORRECT_ANSWER, lowest log probability
                ...
                WRONG_ANSWER, lowest log probability
                ...
                WRONG_ANSWER, highest log probability
                ...
            (n) UNKNOWN_ANSWER(s)

        We then use standard information retrieval metrics, such as RR and
        nDCG, to score the model using the rankings obtained using the strategy
        described above.

    III. Datasets

        There are two ranking tasks in the MS MARCO benchmark: document ranking
        and passage ranking. Both of these tasks have several tracks, using
        different subsets for the evaluation of the models. This scenario
        currently supports the passage ranking task tracks.

        All the datasets used in this scenario are hosted and retrieved from one
        of the following repositories:

            Official MS MARCO Website      | https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/
            Benchmarking CodaLab Worksheet | https://worksheets.codalab.org/worksheets/0xf451c0dec2a6414aae0b68e8e325426c  # noqa
            TREC Website                   | https://trec.nist.gov

        This scenario makes use of 4 different types of files, explanation for
        each is given below, followed by a table listing the details for each
        of the datasets used.

            document: The document files contain all the documents that could be
                ranked for a question, each specified with an document ID
                (docid). For example, for the passage track, the documents would
                be passages.
            query: The query files contain the questions for a given task,
                each specified with a query ID (qid). Each task has a query file
                including the training examples. The validation queries are
                determined by the selected track of the task. Depending on the
                task and split/track, the queries read from the queries file
                are filtered to ensure they have corresponding qrels and top-k
                information before instances for the query are created. Because
                of this filtering, the number of queries in the query file
                doesn't directly correspond the number of queries for which
                instances can be created.
            qrels: Each query file is accompanied by a qrels file, which
                specifies the relationship between a query with ID qid and an
                document with ID docid. The relevance values can have different
                meanings depending on the split and the track. Note that not
                all queries would have corresponding query relevances in the
                accompanied file. Also note that multiple documents may have the
                same relevance value with a qiven query.
            topk: Each query file is accompanied by a top-k file, which lists
                the IDs of the top k best documents for a query with their
                accompanied rank. The top documents for each query were selected
                using the BM25 algorithm. The notebook used to generate the
                top-k files used in this scenario can be found at the
                Benchmarking CodaLab Worksheet. Note that not all queries would
                have a corresponding top-k documents in the accompanied file.

                Notes:
                    (1) We use a pre-processed version of the passage
                        collection, introduced in (MacAvaney, et. al. 2021),
                        which greatly improves the quality of the passages. The
                        cleaned collection is hosted on the Benchmarking CodaLab
                        Worksheet as there is no other reliable publicly hosted
                        copy.
                    (2) The only relevance values is 1, which indicates that the
                        document with the ID the docid is the gold match for the
                        query with the ID qid.
                    (3) The number of top documents ranked was limited to 20 for
                        the training set as we only generate 2 instances per
                        training query, one corresponding to a gold matching
                        instance, and the other one corresponding to a probable
                        non-matching instance.
                    (4) The labels (qrels) of the official test queries are not
                        publicly released. Since we need to have access to the
                        qrels file to evaluate the models, we instead use the
                        development set ("queries.dev.small.tsv"), which can be
                        found at
                        https://msmarco.blob.core.windows.net/msmarcoranking/collectionandqueries.tar.gz
                    (5) The relevance values for the TREC task of the passage
                        track can be any of [0, 1, 2, 3]. We consider [0, 1] to
                        be wrong matches and [2, 3] to be gold matches.

    IV. Baselines

        Currently, we use 4 baselines for the MS MARCO scenario, details for
        which are summarized in the table below.

            Baseline | The baseline name.
            #VR      | Number of validation requests. For each effective
                       validation query, multiple requests would be created,
                       governed by the provided parameters.

        | Baseline                |  #VR   | Parameters
        | regular_topk            | 10,000 | track=regular,use_topk_passages=True,valid_topk=50
        | regular_topk_with_qrels | 10,085 | track=regular,use_qrels_passages=True,use_topk_passages=True,valid_topk=50
        | trec_topk               | 4300   | track=trec,use_topk_passages=True,valid_topk=100
        | trec_qrels              | 9260   | track=trec,use_qrels_passages=True

        On average, the requests for the MS MARCO scenario have ~550 tokens
        using the GPT-2 tokenizer. Multiplying this number with the #VR column
        gives an estimate on the number of request tokens that would be required
        to run the given baseline on GPT models.
