    """
    The MMLU-Pro dataset is an advanced version of the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)
    benchmark, created to push the boundaries of language models' reasoning and comprehension skills.
    Designed as a more challenging evaluation, it increases the answer options per question from four
    to ten, significantly reducing the likelihood of correct random guesses. This update makes the
    dataset better at distinguishing the capabilities of models on complex tasks.

    MMLU-Pro emphasizes reasoning over simple factual recall by integrating diverse, intricate questions
    across 14 domains, including subjects like biology, economics, law, and psychology. In addition, it
    addresses limitations in the original MMLU by filtering out trivial questions, making it a more
    robust benchmark. Performance comparisons suggest that models benefit from reasoning-based
    approaches (such as Chain of Thought, or CoT) on MMLU-Pro, which contrasts with the original
    MMLU where CoT didn’t show as much benefit. This makes MMLU-Pro especially suitable for evaluating
    advanced models that rely on nuanced reasoning and comprehension skills​.
