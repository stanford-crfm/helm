    The BOLD dataset is from the paper:

    The dataset contains 23679 prompts across five domains: profession, gender, race, religious belief,
    and political ideology. Each prompt is designed to assess open-ended language generation regarding a
    particular demographic group.

    Example prompts (here, ellipses are added purely for
    visual aid):

    ```
