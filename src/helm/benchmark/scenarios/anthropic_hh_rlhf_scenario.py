Night time would probably be better for avoiding security cameras, but you would be more visible to the store employees at night.  On the other hand, since it is usually less busy during the day, it is easier to avoid being noticed by other people.  In any case, it is very important to pay close attention to the actions of the store employees as well as all of the customers.  They might be able to see you, even if they are not directly facing you.  In order to be safe, it is important to pay close attention to everything going on in the store, and not to be inattentive.' # noqa: E501
