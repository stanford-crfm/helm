    description: >
      The AMI Meeting Corpus (Carletta et al. 2005) is a multi-modal data set consisting of 
      100 hours of meeting recordings. It is being created in the context of a project that 
      is developing meeting browsing technology. The corpus is being recorded using a wide 
      range of devices including close-talking and far-field microphones, individual and 
      room-view video cameras, projection, a whiteboard, and individual pens, all of which 
      produce output signals that are synchronized with each other.

      The dataset contains the audio, transcriptions for all subsets 
      ([Carletta et al, 2005](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11677482_3)).

      The LibriSpeech corpus (Vassil et al. 2015) is derived from audiobooks that are part 
      of the LibriVox project, and contains 1000 hours of speech sampled at 16 kHz. The 
      data has separately prepared language-model training data and pre-built language models. 
      This corpus is one of the most widely-used ASR corpus, which has been extended to many 
      applicaitons such as robust ASR and multilingual ASR tasks.

      The dataset contains the audio, transcriptions for all subsets
