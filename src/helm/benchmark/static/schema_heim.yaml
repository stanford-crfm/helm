    MS-COCO and generated a single image for each prompt using the text-to-image generation
    model that we are evaluating. Then, we used [pytorch-fid](https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid)
    to compute the FID between the set of real images associated with the prompts
    and the set of generated images.
