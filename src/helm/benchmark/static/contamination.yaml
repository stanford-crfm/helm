    description: Brown et al. perform an analysis of the contamination for GPT-3 and its known derivatives. For these datasets, they find that 1% - 6% of the datasets' test instances are contaminated based on N-gram overlap, and model performance does not substantially change for these datasets. See Table C.1 on page 45 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf.
