  - name: method
    description: The high-level strategy for converting instances into a prompt for the language model.
    values:
      - name: generation
        description: Given the input, the model generates the output free-form.
      - name: multiple_choice_joint
        description: Given the input, the model selects from multiple-choice options (A., B., C., D., E.).
      - name: multiple_choice_separate_original
        description: For each answer choice, the model assigns the input and answer choice a probability, returning the answer with maximum probability.
      - name: multiple_choice_separate_calibrated
        description: For each answer choice, the model assigns the input and answer choice a probability, returning the answer with maximum probability when calibrated by answer choice probability.
      - name: language_modeling
        description: Given the input, the model assigns the sequence a probability.
  - name: instructions
    description: The description of the task that is included at the very beginning of the prompt.
  - name: global_prefix
    description: The string that is prepended to the prompt.
  - name: global_suffix
    description: The string that is appended to the prompt.
  - name: instance_prefix
    description: The string that is included before each instance (e.g., '\n\n').
  - name: input_prefix
    description: The string that is included before each input (e.g., 'Question:').
  - name: input_suffix
    description: The string that is included after each input (e.g., '\n').
  - name: reference_prefix
    description: The string that is included before each reference (for multiple-choice questions).
  - name: reference_suffix
    description: The string that is included after each reference (for multiple-choice questions).
  - name: output_prefix
    description: The string that is included before the correct answer/predicted output (e.g., 'Answer:').
  - name: output_suffix
    description: The string that is included after the correct answer/predicted output (e.g., '\n').
  - name: substitutions
    description: A list of regular expression substitutions (e.g., replacing '\n' with ';\n') to perform at the very end on the prompt.
  - name: max_train_instances
    description: Maximum number of training instances to include in the prompt (currently by randomly sampling).
  - name: max_eval_instances
    description: Maximum number of instances to evaluate on (over all splits - test, valid, etc.).
  - name: num_outputs
    description: Maximum number of possible outputs to generate by sampling multiple outputs.
  - name: num_train_trials
    description: Number of trials, where in each trial we choose an independent, random set of training instances. Used to compute variance.
  - name: sample_train
    description: If true, randomly sample N training examples; if false, select N consecutive training examples
  - name: model
    description: DEPRECATED. Name of the language model (<creator_organization>/<model name>) to send requests to.
  - name: model_deployment
    description: Name of the language model (<host_organization>/<model name>) to send requests to.
  - name: temperature
    description: Temperature parameter used in generation.
  - name: max_tokens
    description: Maximum number of tokens to generate.
  - name: stop_sequences
    description: List of sequences, where we stop generation if we encounter any of them.
  - name: random
    description: Random seed (string), which guarantees reproducibility.
  - name: multi_label
    description: If true, for instances with multiple correct reference, the gold answer should be considered to be all of the correct references rather than any of the correct references.
