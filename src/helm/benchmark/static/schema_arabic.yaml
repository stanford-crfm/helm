    display_name: '# eval'
    description: Number of evaluation instances.

    description: Number of training instances (e.g., in-context examples).
  - name: prompt_truncated
    display_name: truncated
    description: Fraction of instances where the prompt itself was truncated (implies that there were no in-context examples).
  - name: finish_reason_length
    display_name: finish b/c length
    description: Fraction of instances where the the output was terminated because of the max tokens limit.
  - name: finish_reason_stop
    display_name: finish b/c stop
    description: Fraction of instances where the the output was terminated because of the stop sequences.
  - name: finish_reason_endoftext
    display_name: finish b/c endoftext
    description: Fraction of instances where the the output was terminated because the end of text token was generated.
  - name: finish_reason_unknown
    display_name: finish b/c unknown
    description: Fraction of instances where the the output was terminated for unknown reasons.
  - name: num_completions
    display_name: '# completions'
    description: Number of completions.
  - name: predicted_index
    display_name: Predicted index
    description: Integer index of the reference (0, 1, ...) that was predicted by the model (for multiple-choice).
  - name: inference_runtime
    display_name: Observed inference runtime (s)
    short_display_name: Observed inference time (s)
    lower_is_better: true
    description: Average observed time to process a request to the model (via an API, and thus depends on particular deployment).
