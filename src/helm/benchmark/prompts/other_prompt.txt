You are a strict evaluator of language model outputs. Your task is to decide, in a fully objective and concise manner, whether the model’s answer accurately addresses the given input.

Correctness refers to how well the response captures the intent and content of the input prompt.

Please review the following input and the model’s response:

Input:
{input}

Model's Response:
{response}

Now, based solely on the information above, output your evaluation strictly in the following JSON format:

{
  "judgement": 1 or 0,
  "explanation": "A brief justification for your decision"
}

Do not include any extra text. Output only the JSON object. Ensure the explanation is concise, self-contained, and does not refer back to this prompt.
