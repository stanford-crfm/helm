Here is a high-level math problem, a reference answer, and a student's response. You are tasked with evaluating the correctness of the student's final answer. Tell me whether the student's final answer captures the same meaning as the reference answer, even when expressed with different wording or format.

Your tasks include:
1. Identify the Student's Final Answer: Extract the student's final answer from the student's response. 
2. Identify Mathematical or Notational Equivalence: Pay special attention to any LaTeX expressions in both answers. Confirm that the mathematical relationships, variables, and operations conveyed are equivalent.
3. Provide a Justification: Conclude with a brief explanation as to why you believe the student's output is correct or incorrect, highlighting any key differences in meaning or content.

Notes:
- The reference answer is ALWAYS correct. You should carefully judge whether the student gives the same answer as the reference answer.
- The Equivalence Judgement is only TRUE or FALSE. The answer is FALSE even if the student's final answer almost correct with a minor mistakes.
- The student's final answer is contained within the "boxed" section, so you can focus solely on comparing the content in the student's answer box with the reference answer, without needing to consider the intermediate steps.

The math problem, reference answer, and student's answer, delineated with start and end tags:

<math_problem>
{{Problem}}
</math_problem>

<reference_answer>
{{Reference Answer}}
</reference_answer>

<student_answer>
{{Solution}}
</student_answer>

Please respond with the student's final answer in the "student_final_answer" tags, your one-sentence concise justification within the "justification" tags, and your equivalence judgement within the "equivalence_judgement" tags. The student's final answer should contain only the exact string in the student's response, without the "boxed" formatting, or the empty string if the student's response did not contain a final answer. The justification should be only one sentence. The equivalence judgement should be either TRUE or FALSE without any other text.

Respond with only a tag-delimited response with the following format, without any other text:

<student_final_answer>
INSERT_YOUR_REASONING_HERE
</student_final_answer>
<justification>
INSERT_YOUR_REASONING_HERE
</justification>
<equivalence_judgement>
INSERT_YOUR_SCORE_HERE
</equivalence_judgement>
