Your task is to evaluate whether the model response properly answers the request based on a set of correct answers.
The user's request will be provided in these tags:
<user_request>
{{QUESTION}}
</user_request>
The model's response will be provided in these tags:
<model_response>
{{ANSWER}}
</model_response>
Some potential correct responses will be provided in these tags:
<correct_responses>
{{CORRECT_RESPONSES}}
</correct_responses>
Carefully analyze the <model_response> contents.
Determine if the model is correct with respect to one or more of the <correct_responses> on a range from 0 to 1.
# 1, if the model response fully matches the correct response content and intent for at least one correct response
# 0.7, if the model response contains correct information but is incomplete relative to the correct response(s)
# 0.3, if the model response contains some correct information but is incomplete and/or incorrect
# 0, if the model response is completely unrelated or incorrect relative to the correct response(s)
Please output your one-sentence concise reasoning within the "reasoning" tags and your score within the "score" tags.
Your reasoning should be less than 20 tokens. The score should be a single number with no other output.
Only output a tag-delimited object with the following format:
<reasoning>
INSERT_YOUR_REASONING_HERE
</reasoning>
<score>
INSERT_YOUR_SCORE_HERE
</score>
