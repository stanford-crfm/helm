    CLIPScore is a reference free metric that can be used to evaluate the correlation between an image
    caption and the content of the image. It has been found to be highly correlated with human judgement.
    Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08718

    We use the TorchMetrics implementation:
    https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/stable/multimodal/clip_score.html.
    The score is bound between 0 and 100, where a score closer to 100 is better.

    Verified implementation against the scores of image-caption pairs from
    https://wandb.ai/dalle-mini/dalle-mini/reports/OpenAI-CLIP-Score-exploration--VmlldzoxNjMwODM1.
