        Create a task on Scale AI and fetch responses from Scale AI if available.

        The intended use is to call it once to create the task, wait a while, and then call it
        later to fetch answers.

        First, attempt to find a Scale AI project for the template. If one exists, reuse that project.
        Otherwise, create a new project using the template.

        Second, attempt to find a Scale AI task inside this project for the fields. If one exists,
        reuse that task. Otherwise, create a new task inside the project using the fields.

        Finally, check if responses are available by checking if the number of workers who have responded
        is equal to the requested number of workers. If so, return those responses.

        This method is idempotent, because projects and tasks are not created if they already exist.

        The cache will store the mappings from template to Scale AI Project ID and from questions to Scale AI
        task ID. If the cache is deleted, the mappings should be conserved on Scale AI side and the API calls
        should return a ScaleDuplicateResource error which is handled by the method. We still prefer to use
        the cache to avoid unnecessary API calls and to not depend on Scale AI side.
