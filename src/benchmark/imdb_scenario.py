    The IMDb dataset is from the paper:
        https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/

    IMDb is a text classification dataset containing 25,000 training reviews and 25,000 test reviews.
    Each sample contains a sentence with its corresponding sentiment (0: negative, 1: positive)

    We prompt models using the following format:
        Review: <passage>
        Sentiment:

        Target completion:
            <sentiment> (<sentiment>:positive or negative)

    Using an example from the training dataset, we have
    Very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers
    to fill in the action for themselves.
    I can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write.
    This film simply smacked of the real world: the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter,
    the live-in relatives and their quarrels, the troubled child who gets knocked up and then,
    typically, drops out of school, a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it.
    2 thumbs up.
    Sentiment:

    Target completion:
        positive
